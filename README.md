# üõ°Ô∏è BruteGuard ‚Äì An SSH Brute Force Detection Script

BruteGuard is a lightweight, cron-powered shell script that parses your system‚Äôs `/var/log/auth.log` to detect SSH brute force attacks. When it spots a suspicious IP address exceeding a defined threshold of failed login attempts, it sends an alert to both your **local Linux user mailbox** and a **temporary email address**.

## üìã Features

- Detects repeated failed SSH login attempts in real time
- Parses `/var/log/auth.log` using Bash (no Python dependencies)
- Sends alerts using `mail` (to both local and external email)
- Configurable attempt threshold and email targets
- Runs automatically every 5 minutes using `cron`
- Simple, secure, and fully reproducible
